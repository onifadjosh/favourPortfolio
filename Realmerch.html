        <h2>Real Merch</h2>
        <p>This e-commerce platform was designed to provide a smooth and engaging online shopping experience for users
            looking to buy branded merchandise. It focuses on clear navigation, mobile responsiveness, and visually
            appealing product presentation.

            The goal was to eliminate the common frustrations found in local online storesâ€”such as poor layout,
            confusing checkout processes, and outdated designâ€”by creating a clean, modern interface with intuitive user
            flows. From browsing items to completing a purchase, every part of the experience is designed to feel
            effortless, secure, and enjoyable.

            The project involved end-to-end design thinking: conducting user research, mapping out flows, building
            wireframes, designing high-fidelity screens, and testing interactions to ensure usability and performance
            across devices.</p>

            <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
            <p>Shopping for branded merchandise online in Nigeria is often inconvenient and frustrating. Many existing
                platforms are cluttered, outdated, and not optimized for mobile users. Customers frequently experience
                poor navigation, unclear product details, and complicated checkout flows, which lead to cart abandonment
                and loss of trust. Thereâ€™s a noticeable gap in the market for a modern, clean, and user-friendly merch
                website that simplifies discovery, highlights products effectively, and ensures a seamless purchase
                experience from start to finish.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <p>To address these challenges, I designed a responsive and modern merch website that prioritizes clarity,
                speed, and ease of use. The platform features a clean grid layout that makes browsing effortless, with
                well-structured product cards, high-quality images, and concise descriptions that help users make
                informed decisions.

                The shopping experience was streamlined from product discovery to checkout â€” with simplified filtering,
                smooth add-to-cart functionality, and a straightforward payment flow. Mobile responsiveness ensures
                users can shop easily across devices, while clear CTAs and real-time feedback build trust and reduce
                friction.

                Every design choice, from typography to spacing and interaction design, was made to enhance usability
                and give users a visually enjoyable, frustration-free shopping experience.</p>

            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>This project involved designing a merchandise e-commerce website focused on delivering a smooth and
                modern shopping experience. The platform allows users to browse and purchase branded items like
                t-shirts, hoodies, caps, and other apparel with ease.

                The design process aimed to solve the problems commonly found in existing local e-commerce sitesâ€”such as
                visual clutter, confusing navigation, and frustrating checkout processes. With a minimalist layout,
                responsive design, and user-centered flow, the website ensures visitors can easily find what theyâ€™re
                looking for and complete their purchases without stress.

                Key screens include a dynamic homepage, clean product grid, detailed product pages, a functional cart
                interface, and a simplified checkout process. From wireframes to high-fidelity prototypes, the design
                reflects a strong balance between aesthetics, usability, and business goals.</p>

        <h2>UX Process</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>User Research</strong>: To understand common frustrations with online merch shopping, I reviewed
                popular e-commerce sites and gathered informal feedback from potential users. Insights revealed that
                users valued fast load times, clear product visuals, and an easy checkout process, but often encountered
                cluttered layouts, slow pages, and unclear CTAs.</li>

            <li><strong>User Flow Mapping</strong>: I outlined the key user journeys such as browsing products, viewing
                product details, adding items to cart, and checking out. The goal was to make each step intuitive and
                reduce unnecessary friction â€” especially on mobile.</li>


            <li><strong>Wireframing</strong>: SLow-fidelity wireframes were sketched to explore layout options and
                content structure. Special focus was placed on the product grid, filters, and cart flow to ensure a
                smooth and accessible experience from discovery to purchase.</li>

            <li><strong>UI Design</strong>: Using Figma, I created high-fidelity screens with a clean, bold visual style
                that aligns with the youthful, trendy nature of merchandise culture. I used generous spacing, consistent
                components, and legible typography (Inter) to ensure a crisp and modern look across devices.</li>

            <li><strong>Prototyping & Interaction</strong>: I developed an interactive prototype to test navigation,
                cart behavior, and the checkout process. I paid special attention to micro-interactions like button
                feedback, image zoom on hover, and confirmation states.</li>

            <li><strong>Usability Testing & Iteration</strong>: After initial testing with a small group, I refined the
                design based on feedback â€” improving mobile responsiveness, spacing in the product grid, and visibility
                of error/success messages during checkout.</li>
