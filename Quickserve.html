        <h2>Quickserve</h2>
        <p>QuickServe is a smart reservation app designed to help users easily book seats at their favorite restaurants
            without the usual stress of walk-ins or long queues. The idea was born out of the growing need for a
            digital-first solution that offers real-time availability, flexible scheduling, and a smooth booking
            experience especially in busy urban areas.

            The app caters to both customers and restaurant owners by simplifying the reservation process. Users can
            explore nearby restaurants, view available time slots, and reserve seats in just a few taps, while
            restaurant managers can manage bookings, avoid overbooking, and offer special deals during off-peak hours.

            From user research to wireframing and UI design, QuickServe focuses on speed, simplicity, and elegance
            giving users the ease to dine without delay.</p>

            <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
            <p>In many busy cities, dining out often involves long wait times, overbooked restaurants, and uncertainty
                about table availability. Customers frequently arrive at restaurants without knowing if seats are
                available, leading to frustration and poor dining experiences.

                On the other hand, many restaurants struggle to efficiently manage reservations, especially during peak
                hours. Walk-ins can disrupt planned seating, and the lack of a centralized reservation system often
                leads to confusion, loss of customers, and underutilized tables during off-peak periods.

                There is a clear need for a seamless, real-time reservation platform that benefits both diners and
                restaurant owners by streamlining the booking process and improving table management.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <p>QuickServe offers a seamless digital platform that allows users to reserve seats at restaurants in real
                time. With an intuitive mobile interface, users can explore nearby restaurants, view available tables,
                and book a reservation within seconds. The app eliminates the guesswork of walk-ins and provides a
                stress-free dining experience.

                For restaurant owners, QuickServe provides a smart reservation management dashboard that helps them
                organize bookings, reduce wait times, avoid overbooking, and optimize table usage throughout the day.
                The system also supports promotional slots for off-peak hours, giving restaurants more control and
                flexibility.

                By bridging the gap between hungry customers and busy restaurants, QuickServe delivers a faster,
                smarter, and more organized way to dine out.

            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>QuickServe is a mobile-first reservation app designed to streamline the process of booking seats at
                restaurants. The app empowers users to discover restaurants, check table availability in real time, and
                reserve seats with ease â€” all from their smartphones.

                The project was inspired by the increasing demand for convenience and time-efficiency in dining
                experiences. With QuickServe, users no longer need to queue or call ahead; instead, they enjoy instant
                access to reservation slots and personalized booking features.

                The design process focused on creating a clean, intuitive user interface that meets the needs of both
                diners and restaurant owners. The goal was to make seat reservations feel effortless while ensuring
                restaurants can manage their bookings effectively. <br>

                <h2>Role</h2>
                <p>As a UI Designer on the QuickServe project, I collaborated with a team of designers to create an
                    intuitive and visually cohesive reservation experience. I focused on designing high-fidelity user
                    interfaces, building consistent design components, and ensuring the app remained user-friendly,
                    accessible, and responsive across devices. My work involved translating user needs into clean
                    layouts while aligning closely with the overall design vision of the team.</p>

        <h2>UX Process</h2>
        The design process for QuickServe followed a user-centered and iterative approach to ensure the product met real
        user needs and business goals. Here's a breakdown of how the process unfolded:
        <ol>
            <li><strong>User Research</strong>: We began by conducting informal interviews and digital surveys with
                potential users, including busy professionals, students, and frequent diners. The goal was to understand
                their dining habits, pain points around reservations, and what features they would value in a
                reservation app. We discovered key frustrations such as:
                <ul>
                    <li>Uncertainty about table availability</li>
                    <li>Long wait times at restaurants</li>
                    <li>Inconvenience of calling ahead or using clunky booking platforms</li>
                </ul>

            </li>


            <li><strong>Defining User Personas & Journey Mapping</strong>: Based on research insights, we created user
                personas and mapped out their typical dining journeys. This helped us identify the most critical
                touchpoints and areas to improve in the reservation flow.</li>

            <li><strong>Wireframing & Information Architecture</strong>: We designed low-fidelity wireframes to
                visualize the structure of the app and how users would navigate through it. Key screens included
                restaurant search, seat availability, reservation confirmation, and user profile.</li>

            <li><strong>Usability Testing (Low-Fidelity)</strong>: We tested early wireframes with a few users to
                validate the flow. Feedback helped us simplify the booking process, reduce the number of steps, and
                clarify restaurant availability indicators.</li>

            <li><strong>High-Fidelity UI Design</strong>: BWith validated wireframes, I moved into high-fidelity UI
                design in Figma. I focused on building a clean, modern interface using consistent design components,
                intuitive icons, and mobile-first layouts. Visual clarity and responsiveness were prioritized.</li>

            <li><strong>Prototyping & Iteration</strong>: Interactive prototypes were created and shared with
                stakeholders and users for feedback. We iterated on visuals, button placements, and onboarding steps
                based on usability feedback. Particular attention was paid to creating a fast, seamless reservation flow
                with minimal friction.</li>
